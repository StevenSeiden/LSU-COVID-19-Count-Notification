# LSU COVID-19 Count Notification Shortcut

This is an unofficial Apple Shortcuts script that scrapes [LSU's Roadmap to Fall](https://www.lsu.edu/roadmap/covid-dashboard/index.php) website and returns the latest COVID-19 case count. This shortcut can be used to send a daily notification through the automation section of Apple Shortcuts.
